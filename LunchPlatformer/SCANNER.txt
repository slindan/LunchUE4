1: Create a new Blueprint Class called Scannable - only needs a Sprite

2: In level: Get all blueprints of Scannable class

3: Put all Scannables in an array in PlayerBP (public array from level BP)


SCAN LOGIC:
1: Get Scannables within range:
	For each Scannable, check distance to player
	For each Scannable, check dot against ForwardVector (scaled on which direction you face as well)
		Get Forward Vec
		Do Player location - Object location (this is the vector from player to object)
		Dot this to get orientation
	If distance and dot is OK, put in array ScannablesInRange

2: If ScannablesInRange is not 0, get the closest scannable:
	For each ScannableInRange, check distance to player
	If less or equal to current closest distance, assign new Closest and new Closest Distance float

3: After the loop, set the color of sprite on closest scannable (stored in a variable)
